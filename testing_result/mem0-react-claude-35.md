You: Why can i alergic to that?
Customer Support: Hi Max, I understand you're asking about allergies. I know from our previous conversations that you have a peanut allergy. While I can provide some general information, I want to note that for specific medical advice about your allergy, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider or allergist.

Peanut allergies occur when your immune system mistakenly identifies peanut proteins as harmful substances and triggers an allergic reaction. This is one of the most common food allergies, and it can range from mild to severe reactions.

Some key points about peanut allergies:
1. They often develop in childhood
2. Can be genetic or develop over time
3. Require strict avoidance of peanuts and peanut-containing products
4. Can cause reactions ranging from mild (like hives) to severe (like anaphylaxis)

For your safety, always:
- Read food labels carefully
- Inform restaurants about your allergy
- Carry any prescribed medication (like an EpiPen if prescribed)

Would you like to discuss any specific concerns about managing your peanut allergy? I'm happy to provide more information about safe foods or tips for avoiding exposure.
