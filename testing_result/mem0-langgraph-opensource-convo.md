Customer Support: I understand you're asking about your peanut allergy, Max. A peanut allergy occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies peanut proteins as harmful substances and reacts defensively against them. This immune response can cause various symptoms ranging from mild to severe.

The exact reason why some people, like yourself, develop peanut allergies isn't fully understood, but factors can include:    

1. Genetics
2. Family history of allergies
3. Environmental factors
4. Early exposure or lack of exposure to peanuts

- Common symptoms to watch for
- Foods to avoid
- Alternative food options
