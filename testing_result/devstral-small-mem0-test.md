--- Query 4 (User: customer_123) ---
You: I recently adopted a cat named Whiskers. Whiskers loves to play with yarn.
Customer Support: Hello Alice! That's wonderful that you've adopted a cat named Whiskers! As someone who loves gardening, you'll need to be careful with some houseplants as they can be toxic to cats. But it's lovely that Whiskers enjoys playing with yarn - just remember to supervise playtime to ensure the yarn doesn't become a hazard.

Since you mentioned you have a peanut allergy, I should also mention that if you use any peanut-based products (like some natural cleaning supplies or certain types of cat litter), you'll want to be extra careful and probably avoid those options.

While I don't have any specific tools to help with cat-related questions, I'm happy to chat about your new furry friend! Would you like any general advice about cat care or how to create a safe environment for Whiskers, especially considering your garden?
